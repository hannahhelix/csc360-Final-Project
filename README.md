# csc360-Final-Project

This is my final project for CSC360 Web Applications at DePaul University. The premise of this project is to create a react frontend application and a dotnet backend application. It will be able to save data into a database, using SQL lite, and provide the user with HTTP basic authentication to handle multiple users. 

I choose to follow an expense tracker for users to track their spending habits and plan to save their money more productively.

Video Of Application will be within the submission folder

## To Use This Application   
### Front End
Open the folder **front/frontend**
Run ```npm start```
This will open up a window in your chosen web browser of the front end.
### Back End
In a separate window, open the folder **/back**

Either: 
- Build the project
-  Start debugger
    - Run as a C# application
    - Choose HTTP instead of HTTPS or any other options. This will open up a window in your chosen web browser where you can visual see the backend of the running application.
